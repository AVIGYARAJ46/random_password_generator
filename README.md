Random Password Generator
This Python script generates a random password of a specified length using a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and punctuation marks.

How it Works
1>Import Necessary Libraries:The script starts by importing the 'random' module for generating random values and the 'string' module for accessing different types of characters.

2>Set Password Length:You can adjust the pass_len variable to set the desired length of the generated password. By default, it's set to 8 characters.

3>Define Character Set:The charvalues variable combines lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation marks using the string module constants

4>Generate Password:The script iterates pass_len times, randomly selecting characters from the defined character set and appending them to the password string.

5>Print Password:Finally, the generated password is printed to the console.

Usage
To generate a password, simply run the script. You can adjust the length of the password by modifying the pass_len variable.
